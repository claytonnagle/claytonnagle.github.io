        I've really been collecting a lot of rocks lately. I got a hobby 
        rock tumbler for my birthday and every time I go out I pick up
        some rocks that look neat. 
    </h2>
    <p>I bought a whole bunch of shungite! Rocks. Do you know what 
        shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge 
        Knight. I think he’s locked up in prison. Talking shungite! 
        Anyways, it’s a 2 billion year old.. like rock, stone that 
        protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that 
        may be traveling in the air. That's my story, I bought a
         whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la casa, little 
         pyramids, stuff like that.
